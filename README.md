# Angular_SpringBoot_FullStack

**Setting Up and Running the Application**

To set up and run the full-stack application, follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository by copying the Git URL from GitHub and running the following command in your designated folder:

```
git clone [Git URL]
```

**Step 2: Open the Editors**
Open your favorite code editor for coding. In this setup, we will use two editors:

Visual Studio Code for Angular Frontend
IntelliJ IDEA for Spring Boot Backend

**Step 3: Install Dependencies and Run the Frontend**
In Visual Studio Code, open the terminal and navigate to the frontend directory of the cloned repository. Then, perform the following steps:

Install the required Node.js modules by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
Run the frontend application using the following command:

```
ng serve
```

**Step 4: Run the Backend**
In IntelliJ IDEA, open the backend directory of the cloned repository. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured.

Run the Spring Boot application using your preferred method within IntelliJ IDEA.

**Step 5: Access the Application**
After completing the previous steps, you can access the full-stack application by opening your web browser and navigating to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

**Note**
Please make sure that both the frontend and backend applications are running simultaneously for the proper functioning of the application.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and enhance the application according to your requirements. Happy coding!
